# postfix-haskell
A very low-level functional programming language designed to compile to WebAssembly in the browser.

## Active development
Although I feel most of the major design aspects are figured out at this point I don't want to go into much detail yet as I still only have half a compiler. If you're curious, look at some of the \[recent] files in `planning/*` and you can play around with an interactive shell by running `node tools/shell.js`

## Why JavaScript?
I'm writing first draft of the compiler in JavaScript so that it can run in browser. Can probably bootstrap the compiler in the distant future
